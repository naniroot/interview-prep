# Interview Prep
- All the files and code that I practiced and will help me get ready for interviewing for now and later.
- Also will help me revise quickly and keep me relevant in the ever changing tech market.

# OO Concepts
- When would you use interface or abstract class? is Queue q = new LinkedList(), here is q an AC or Interface? Why?
- When would you call the function in the super class?
- Telescoping classes
- What would happen when you assign a subclass object to a super class object? when would you do that if you can? what about vice versa.
- Of course questions like design a parking lot.
